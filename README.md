# The General Adaptive Agency (GAA) Framework
### A First-Principles Model of Adaptive Systems

---

## Introduction

This repository contains the complete working paper for the General Adaptive Agency (GAA) framework. This framework proposes a universal, scale-invariant language to describe any adaptive systemâ€”from a subatomic particle to a business, a mind, or an ecosystem.

The core of the theory is the principle that the viability of any agent can be understood as a dynamic balance between two fundamental forces:

* **Traction (`T`):** The forces of Order, capability, and effective action.
* **Friction (`F`):** The forces of Chaos, resistance, and decay.

The agent's overall health is measured by its **Net Strategic Vitality (`NSV = T - F`)**. The GAA provides a complete system for modeling, calculating, and improving an agent's `NSV` over time.

## Purpose of this Repository

This paper is a work in progress and is being shared publicly to invite discussion, critique, and collaboration from experts across various fields. The goal is to build a robust, interdisciplinary conversation around a new science of agency.
